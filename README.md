# Multi-Class-Perceptron-Coursework
This coursework is from a university module i took on machine learning.

This coursework focuses on designing and analysing the performance of a multi class perceptron algorithm using PCA. The data is then projected into a higher dimensional subspace using an RBF Kernel, which is a non-linear manifold learning technique so that the data can be separated by a hyper-plane.
The best Hyper-Parameters are found by using a gridsearch function for the best top number of PC's and variable gamma to use.

Please see the pdf report and jupyter notebooks for more information
